# 📋 Company Details Guide

> How to use the COMPANY_DETAILS.md file to get better AI-generated documents

## Why This Matters

When you use AI tools (Grok, ChatGPT, Claude) without context, you get generic output. 

**With company details**, you get documents that actually fit your business.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Create Your File
1. Copy `COMPANY_DETAILS_TEMPLATE.md`
2. Rename to `COMPANY.md`
3. Fill in your specifics

### Step 2: Use With AI Prompts

**Before (generic output):**
```
"Write a job description for a Project Manager"
```

**After (personalized output):**
```
"Based on our company:
- Industry: Construction
- Size: 15 employees
- Location: Fort Worth, TX
- Revenue: $2M
- Culture: Casual, family-oriented

Write a job description for a Project Manager..."
