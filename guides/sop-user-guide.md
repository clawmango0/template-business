### Step 2: Customize for Your Company

{{DATE}}            → Current date
{{AUTHOR}}          → Document owner

```

## Template Structure Explained

### Required Sections

Every SOP should include:

1. **Purpose** - Why does this process exist?
2. **Scope** - Who/what does it apply to?
3. **Responsibilities** - Who does what?
4. **Procedure** - Step-by-step instructions
5. **Forms/Appendices** - Supporting documents
6. **Revision History** - Track changes

### Optional Sections

- **Glossary** - Define technical terms
- **References** - Related documents
- **Training Requirements** - What's needed to execute

---

## Best Practices

### Writing Clear Procedures

✅ **Do:**
- Use action verbs (Create, Review, Approve)
- Number steps sequentially
- Include responsible party
- Add checkpoints for critical steps

❌ **Don't:**
- Use vague language ("as appropriate")
- Skip prerequisites
- Assume knowledge

### Example - Good vs Bad

| Bad | Good |
|-----|------|
| "Process the request" | "Review request in ServiceNow, approve or reject within 24 hours" |
| "Notify relevant parties" | "Email department manager and IT security within 1 hour" |

---

## Maintenance

### Review Schedule

| SOP Type | Review Frequency |
|----------|-----------------|
| Critical (Security) | Quarterly |
| Operations | Bi-annually |
| Administrative | Annually |

### Update Triggers

- Process changes
- New tools/systems
- Regulatory requirements
- After incidents
- Annual review

### Revision Process

1. Draft changes in tracked changes
2. Submit for review
3. Get approval
4. Update version number
5. Publish and communicate

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too long** - Keep under 10 pages
2. **Too complex** - Simplify workflows
3. **Out of date** - Regular reviews
4. **No ownership** - Assign document owner
5. **No training** - Just sharing ≠ adoption

| Confluence | Paste markdown or import |
